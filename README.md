# Fullstack Crud Application

In this application we are in a group of four and creating an application that will show off images. Each photo will show the user the name, image URL, author and a URL (if applicable). 

###### The client and server based application will allow a user to:
- View a list of items 
- Create an item 
- Update an item 
- Delete an item. 

The items that will showcased on the website will be held in a database on a backend server, Firebase. Firebase will hold the images in Cloud Storage and the properties will be stored in a databse.

##### Featues we are planning to add after we create the MVP:
- Search Bar / Filter
- Image Tags
- Login
- Up / Down Vote
- Comments
- Caterogies
- Refresh Button
